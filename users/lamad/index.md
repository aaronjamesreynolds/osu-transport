### Background
I am a fourth year graduate student in Nuclear Engineering at OSU, working with Dr. Todd Palmer as an advisor and project leader. I got my undergraduate degree in Physics and Minor in Mathematics at California State University, Sacramento (CSUS). During my time at CSUS, I was a member of Zigma Pi Zigma society in Physics. I joined the team in the Fall of 2016 and have been working in the field of transport and reactor physics since. I received an MS in Nuclear Engineering from OSU in 2019 and currently working towards a Ph.D.

I worked on two different projects (stochastic mixing of materials, and multiband cross section generation) during my first three years with Dr. Palmer. I've also had the opportunity to intern at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for two summers (2017 and 2018). Currently my work is focused on Thermal Radiation Transport.

### Projects
* Master's Thesis
  * I received a Master's degree for my work on Multigroup Multiband cross section generation. The goal of the project is to generate high fidelity nuclear cross sections using the Multigroup Multiband method. The method involved running a Monte Carlo simulation of interest. Using the flux from the Monte Carlo simulation as a weighting function, cross sections are generated.

* Ph.D. Dissertation
  * I am working on a new method for solving the Thermal Radiation Transport (TRT) equation. The method looks to improve on the Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) framework for the TRT equations.
